# GyroSense-
Algorithm for gyro initialization, calibration, and data processing


The algorithm initializes the gyroscope, performs a functional test and ground calibration to calculate initial offsets. It then reads angular velocity data (3 axes) in 3 bytes per axis, corrects the data based on the offsets, and prints or sends it to a controller. It provides feedback for each operation, ensuring reliability and fast error diagnosis.
